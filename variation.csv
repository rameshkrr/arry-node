The unique, polymer based formula provides a breathable barrier¹ to promote skin health in patients at risk for skin damage from incontinence.

Cavilon Durable Barrier Cream contains a unique blend of 3M polymers and dimethicone for skin protection as well as conditioning ingredients for moisturisation.

Creams always have a soothing lipid component in addition to a high water content.
The smooth, white cream does not contain hormones (oestrogens) and can therefore be used together with hormone replacement therapy or be alternated with hormone-based (oestrogen) vaginal creams or pessaries. Through the addition of lactic acid, the pH value of the cream is 4.5 and, as such, Vagisan MoistCream helps to maintain the natural acidity (pH) in the vagina.
Regular use of Vagisan MoistCream can help to prevent irritation and inflammation in the vagina and external genital area caused by dryness.
